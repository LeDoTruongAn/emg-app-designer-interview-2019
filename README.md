# App Designer Interview 2019

## Requirements

* Represent the information regarding the submission of feedback forms to lecturers and instructors of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

* A typical feedback form consists some questions where students have to give a numerical “grade” and one or more comments fields.

* Typically, lecturers/instructors would like to see a summary of the feedbacks in addition to going through them individually.

Recording the identity of the students with their feedback is not expected, but if the student prefers to do so they should have this option. One student is allowed to give only one feedback in one turn; however they are allowed to change it at any time later.

* All the modifications to the feedback should be tracked. In addition, you will have to consider factors such as courses conducted by more than one lecturer and students belonging to different departments.

* This description is kept vague to a certain extent so that you have the opportunity to come up with the details. For instance, you can think about allowing lecturers/instructors to respond to feedbacks.

We developed the web interface of the application very similar to that of Moodle, as we had the base idea of integration of this with Moodle in our minds. We used the same Cascading Style Sheets that are used with Moodle and this helped us create our UI simple and sleek.

## What we want to receive from your design:
* Your design languages
* Your app design trends
* Your pace on designing an application.
* Your work-items and how long it take for each.

## Caution
I do know the above requirements that will require a massive works from you to complete. However, I really want to see how fast you can produce your works as we're playing product development game.
